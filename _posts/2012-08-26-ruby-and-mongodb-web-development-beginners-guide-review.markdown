Yesterday night I read [Ruby-and-MongoDB-Web-Development-Beginners-Guide](http://www.packtpub.com/ruby-and-mongodb-web-development-beginners-guide/book) written by [Gautam Rege](https://twitter.com/gautamrege). I know Gautam personly so was very excited to read this book. He is very energetic guy and he takes care of [Pune Ruby meetup group](http://www.meetup.com/PuneRailsMeetup/). He and his company [Josh](http://joshsoftware.com/) are very active in open source community. 

***My thoughts on book***

The book is not quite a reference manual, nor is it a tutorial. It is more of a practical book where you code while reading. It is very handy, if you know programing you can finish it in 8-10 hour. It is nice to see that Gautam has made mongoDB approachable to new developer, it covers all the major pieces of mongoDb. In the book he has created a hypothetical `Sodibee(pronounced as |saw-d-bee|) Library Manager` example, by which he has explained most of the mongoDB concepts. The other good thing, which I like about book, is that the transition in between relational database concepts to NoSQL is very smooth. At most of the places he has compared relational database with NoSQL so it help to connect better. The punch `tips` and `Time for Action` in between the book are nice.

***Topics which book has covered?***

The book cover following topics: 

- Installation and Configuration 
- Comparison between relational queries with mongoDB
- Ruby Data mappers
- MongoMapper 
- Modeling Ruby with Mongoid
- Geospatial Indexing 
= Achieving High Performance on Your Ruby Application with MongoDB
- Scaling MongoDB

***Target Audience***

I feel that this book is written keeping in mind that you are new to NoSQL and mongoDB. You should have basic knowledge of ruby to start this book.

***Conclusion***

I will recommend this read to developers. 

***If you want to use ruby with mongoDB, Gautam has connected the dots with this book. ***
