A month back I started exploring [RubyMotion](http://www.rubymotion.com/). On the very first release it has created a buzz in the market, initially I thought it was hyped. Unless I myself worked on this and found that this may revolutionizes the mobile development. So thought to write a review for it.

###Things which made me crazy


***No Objective C***

I hate writing code in Objective C, for doing a simple thing we have to write lot of code. Though it is a powerful language but if you have worked on language like ruby and python then it is difficult to work with objective C. As RubyMotion is based on ruby, and with language like ruby you can do many thing in few line and it is simple to understand. 


***Good Performance:*** 

RubyMotion is much faster then phongap,titanium, rhodes and other framework. RubyMotion compiles Ruby and activates a load of performance optimizations, such as 
inline method caching, immediate fixed and floating numeric types, zero-cost exceptions, promotion of variables into CPU registers, cached constant lookups, tail-call optimization, dead code elimination, and many more. 

***No need to think about memory managment***

This is selling point of RubyMotion. It automatically cares of memory allocation and deallocation. Developers who have work on Objective C must know the pain.

***I love Console***

RubyMotion use rake command for common tasks and you can choose your favorite IDE to work on it. I feel confortable using console as compare to Xcode.

***Just can do any thing***

Other popular framework available for mobile development like Phonegap, Appcelerator, Rhodes etc  developer can only implement few thing which the framework support.  But with Ruby Motion you can do anything which apple support. We canâ€™t create any graphical game or image processing application with Phonegap, Appcelerator etc.but with RubyMotion we can do. There is many more examples for this case.

***Big name behind RubyMotion*** 

This framework is created by [Laurent Sansonetti](http://chopine.be/) who was Apple employee and creator of [Mac Ruby](http://macruby.org/), a widely-used implementation of Ruby for Mac. It is maintained by Apple for over 4 years. And RubyMotion is created using Mac ruby. 


###Things which can improve: 


- No good documentation.

- As of now the community is very small. The reason may be it is new and paid.

- To quickly start with RubyMotion you need knowledge of Apple API's and Mac Ruby. Like other framework you can work on HTML5 and JavaScript.

- Not Cross platform: RubyMotion only support iOS as of now. I am not sure it is an advantage or disadvantage. 

###Who should try this.
If you have worked with ruby and interest in mobile development than defintley give a try.
